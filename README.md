# Portfolio-Website-with-Flask
Creating a portfolio website using Flask is a practical way to showcase your skills and projects while learning web development fundamentals. Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, allows you to build dynamic web applications with minimal setup. The project begins by setting up Flask routing in `app.py`, which defines how users navigate between pages like the homepage and contact form. The homepage (`index.html`) should include your personal information, a brief bio, and highlights of your key projects. Styling is handled with CSS to give the site a clean, professional look. Adding a contact form (`contact.html`) enables visitors to send messages, which can be logged or stored for future use. This form uses HTML input fields and Flaskâ€™s request handling to process submissions. Static assets like CSS files are stored in a `static` folder, while HTML templates go in a `templates` folder. The final deliverable is a complete Flask project folder that can be run locally or deployed online. This mini web app not only demonstrates your technical abilities but also serves as a real-world tool for networking and job applications.
